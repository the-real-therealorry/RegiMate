        question: "what is the minimum height for a power outlet?",
        answer: "According to the Australian/New Zealand Wiring Rules (AS/NZS 3000:2018), there is no specific minimum height requirement for general power outlets in residential installations. However, industry practice typically places them at 300mm above the finished floor level. For kitchens and other wet areas, outlets should be at least 150mm above benchtops and at least 300mm away from sinks.",

        question: "maximum circuit breaker size for 12 AWG wire",
        answer: "For 12 AWG copper wire with 90Â°C insulation (THHN, THWN-2, etc.), the maximum circuit breaker size is 20 amperes per the National Electrical Code. This is based on the wire's ampacity rating and the requirement to protect the conductor from overcurrent conditions.",

        answer: "In residential bathrooms, lighting must be controlled by a wall switch located at the entrance. At least one light fixture must be installed in every bathroom, and all lighting fixtures in wet locations must be rated for damp or wet locations. Recessed fixtures must be specifically labeled for use in wet areas if installed in shower or tub zones.",

This separation is required to prevent potential ignition of gas leaks by electrical arcing and to ensure safe access to both utilities for maintenance and emergency situations.",
